Hello there! I am Chaitanya.

I canâ€™t say I love to read, listen and watch but I do read books and articles, listen to podcasts and watch a very small subset of videos and movies. I am enrolled in the Bachelor of Design programme at the Department of Design, IIT Guwahati. My interests in the field of design include typography, type design, and creative coding.
