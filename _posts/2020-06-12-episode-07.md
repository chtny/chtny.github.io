Hello there! This is Put It On Paper, today we have Anshuman Dhar with us. Anshuman is graduating this year from the Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, having studied Chemical Engineering with a minor in Design. His minor is the major part of his work now and we will be talking about that journey. Anshuman also co-founded CMD+J mentor ship platform. This is episode one of four. The next three episodes would be coming up this coming Monday, Wednesday and Friday. This episode continues from where we left in the last one where I answered Anshumanâ€™s question about why I started this podcast.
