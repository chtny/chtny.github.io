If you ever find yourself to be the only one in a group criticising big tech companies, here are some Wikipedia pages that could help you generate more points for your defence/attack:

- [Criticism of Amazon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Amazon)
- [Criticism of Apple Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Apple_Inc.)
- [Criticism of Facebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Facebook)
- [Criticism of Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Google)
- [Criticism of Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Microsoft)
- [Criticism of Uber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Uber_(company))
- [Criticism of Huawei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Huawei)
- [Criticism of Dell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Dell)

Interestingly, Samsung, IBM and Intel do not have one of these Wikipedia pages. If you are looking for some points on other big companies [here is the link where you can find more of such pages!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Criticisms_of_companies) I do not know why I have the curiosity to read through these pages and the energy to tell my friends about these in random conversations.
