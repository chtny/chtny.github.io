I started blogging back in 2012, when I was just 12 years old. Wandering around the internet, I came across Weebly and WordPress. No one around me knew about such platforms. It was the novelty of the idea of having my website that made me start blogging. I have struggled through all these nine years, and I won't lie about that.

One of the main reasons has been that same feeling of being novel about the platform I use to make the website. I have tried everything, but for most of the years, I stuck to WordPress. Of course, WordPress brings a whole bunch of plugins and themes to choose from and use. And it's all PHP which hence became the first language I learned for just customising my blog.

I think you get the idea that I spent more time thinking about the platform and having fun with all the customisations than actually writing something meaningful. I don't regret that, but I don't want that to happen again.

I have deleted everything on my WordPress installation. Everything is now made with Jekyll. I know changing of platform won't make much of a difference because I have done this many times before, but I hope that not being spoiled from choice would let me publish a small piece every few days. And I just need to push a markdown file, that's comparatively easier since I have been using Obsidian a lot.

Cheers to a restart!
