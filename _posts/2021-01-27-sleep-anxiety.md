**sleep**: to rest in a state of reduced consciousness<br>
**anxiety**: an unpleasant state of mental uneasiness, nervousness, apprehension and obsession or concern about some uncertain event

Here is the obvious fix to *my* sleep anxiety: MENTALLY PREPARE MYSELF FOR SLEEPING AT THE SAME TIME EVERY DAY. But it is definitely not as easy as it may sound. An even better fix: WAKE UP EARLY AT THE SAME TIME EVERY DAY. This way, I get tired by the time I have to sleep, and I can fall off without giving my mind time to go into an endless spiral.

But given that I am already in that spiral, why should I not give 100 Days To Offload a second go? **Doing something I have been stalling for a long time somehow helps me to sleep too.** I will try to refine my writing going forward. For the time being this series is just going to be about offloading as raw as it comes.
