Jump all walls that surround me, but don’t force yourself upon me. When that happens, I distance myself from the person; the relationship suffers. It suffers to the point until it exists, usually ending without many words exchanged. I might be a coward, maybe ignorant, probably got some ego issues. But I don’t want to be the one who feels intoxicated in a relationship of two – I don’t want the other person to feel the same. So, I distance myself.

Would this bite me someday when I get it too wrong, probably? I am figuring this out to maybe some better way to get things right instead of leaving them altogether.
