Hello there! This is Put It On Paper, today well I am alone. Sort of. In the first half, it is just me talking about permission marketing, activism and a little bit about mental health. The second half was actually supposed to be part of the next episode dropping on Friday where I have Anshuman Dhar as my guest. But I thought Iâ€™ll just add it here because it is less about Anshuman and more about me. He asks me why I started this podcast and I give a very confused answer.
