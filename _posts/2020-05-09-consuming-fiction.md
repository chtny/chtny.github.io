I have not been able to read fiction books for a long time. Probably, around three years ago was the last time I read a novel per se, and that was on the recommendation of the girl I was dating at that time. But on my own, I have not picked up a fiction book for a good 5 to 6 years now.

I think the same trend has been with movies and tv series lately. Most of the film and tv series I have watched have been recommendations by people around me. Apart from the Jack Ryan series on Amazon Prime, I haven’t been successful at watching shows on my own. The Intern is probably one of the last movies I watched, which was not a recommendation. I have left most of the TV shows people have recommended in the middle. The Big Bang Theory, How I Met Your Mother, Two and a Half Men – I left them all after the fifth or sixth season.

The same trend does not exist for a non-fiction book, feature documentaries and docuseries.

But this past week, I started listening to Marvel’s Wolverine. And now I am genuinely interested in listening to more fiction podcasts. I think I have returned to consuming regular fiction for the first time in 6 years!
