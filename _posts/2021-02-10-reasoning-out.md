There are many different and conflicting ideologies to choose from in our world. According to what a person decides, their actions follow to reflect those ideas. At the same time, what is acceptable and not-acceptable to form a consensus in a large population has a rigid set of requirements. What these conditions are is unknown to me as of now. But I see many people around who try reason out (forcefully) their actions and ideas. You don't need logical reasoning. You just need some explanation which seems reasonable. Whoever can persuade other people in accepting their reasons is also able to propagate their ideas. The chain continues till someone with conflicting views feels threatened and wishes to remove the conflict (forcefully), especially when they have a majority.
