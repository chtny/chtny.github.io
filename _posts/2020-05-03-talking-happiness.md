In the last 24 hours or so I have finally started talking to more people. I had sort of cut myself out from talking to a lot of people in the last month or so. More like just 20 people existed around me out of the hundreds I knew before. I even made some new friends. I wasn’t feeling right for a few days, but talking to people has made me happy. It always does. But I still cut this source of happiness a month back.
