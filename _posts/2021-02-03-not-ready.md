We got an email today from the Dean of Students' Affairs at the university. They announced that the decision to call us back to campus has been made and soon the phased process would start. It would probably be in March that I get to go back to campus. But I am not ready for it.

I have wanted to go back since the day we were sent home in mid March 2020. I was even reluctant to come back home because I had just reached back to the campus a week before. For most part of the 12 months I was eager to go back, but there has been a change in the last few months. I think it hit me too late that I have been without physical human interactions for so long.

I have now bundled down into myself which does not want to get exposed.
