Given the choice of having dinner with anyone in the world, I would always end up choosing to eat alone. I have not done this a lot, but eating alone seems to have been contemplatively fun. I also end up appreciating the food I eat more. I would surely choose to have people around for snacks and games, but when the meal is long, and the place matches my mood, I think I would like to have it alone.
