I had made some big plans for the ongoing semester at college and also for the upcoming summer vacation – my first in college. By big, I mean – reading big books and learning more stuff. And then the whole of India went under lockdown with most of the world during this ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. And with that my plans went dead too. The only thing I have been able to get myself so far to do staying home is to sleep around 10 pm and wake up at 4 am.

Of course, it does not happen every day. In my three weeks of trying this out, I have not had a streak of more than three days. And here are the reasons why:

1.  Unwanted tension (the one I should let go of)
2.  Listening to podcasts
3.  Reading books
4.  Writing notes
5.  Watching Numberphile and BBC Earth videos on YouTube
6.  Texting friends
7.  Reading newsletters
