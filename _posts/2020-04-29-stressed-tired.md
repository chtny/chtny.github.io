Roaming around the internet isn’t as bad as I used to tell myself. Of course, most of the things I have been able to consume – podcasts, blogs and books – have been because of roaming around the internet. A few days ago, I found a table on Reddit explaining what to do when you are stressed or tired. As it turns out, I have already been doing the same four things without ever putting them down as suggestive rules! A summary of the two by two table (excluding both column and row headings) in four lines:

When you are stressed and tired: drink water. <br>
When you are stressed but not tired: meditate.<br>
When you are tired but not stressed: take a nap.<br>
When you are neither stressed nor tired, enjoy!
