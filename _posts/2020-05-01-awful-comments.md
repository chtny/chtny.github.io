I think I spend more time reading comments below posts on Instagram, Reddit, Twitter and YouTube than actually making any reasonable use of these “social networking” platforms. These comments get as awful and insane as they can get. Though initially, this exercise seems like a waste of time, I think it helps me understand what people are thinking. Most of the time, my mood gets a big hit. I don’t feel right.
