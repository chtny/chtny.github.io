Initially, I thought of having each episode to be around 15 minutes. But while recording I realised that it might be really hard for me at the start to keep my listeners interested in the episode. So from 15 minutes, it has now come down to between 7 and 10 minutes. I also recorded a separate episode introducing the podcast.

I know small tasks add to the whole, but recording the pilot episode made me realise I can do the same with my episodes. Keep them short in the beginning and increase the length if needed as my speaking skills and my audience grows. Both the introductory and the first episode would be out tomorrow on May 1, 2020, at 12 noon IST.
