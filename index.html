  <h1>Chaitanya <small>(he/him)</small></h1>
  <p>Hello there! I canâ€™t say I love to read, listen and watch but I do read books and articles, listen to podcasts and watch a very small subset of videos and movies. Since July 2019, I am enrolled in the Bachelor of Design programme at the Department of Design, IIT Guwahati. My interests in the field of design include print publishing, typography, type design and interactive media. I write a weekly newsletter called <a href="https://slightlymodest.substack.com/">Slightly Modest</a>. I also have a Tumblr where <a href="https://haikujar.tumblr.com/">I write haiku</a>. You can listen to <a href="https://pod.link/1511066766">my old podcast</a> here. I have deleted my blog.</p>
  <p>Have a good day!</p>
