## Link Magazine
![12 sample pages from the Link Magazine](https://chaitanya.page/assets/images/link-magazine.png)

*2 weeks in March 2020* 

For their 7th edition, the Technical Board of IIT Guwahati introduced their first ever magazine, showcasing all the events, projects, and competitions their teams have participated in.

With Disha, Rohit, Devanshi and Pranay, I got the opportunity to design the magazine from front to end, keeping in mind the spirit of the Technical Board, to evoke inspiration amongst students to engage more with the technical community.
